## About

[Tandoor recipes](https://github.com/TandoorRecipes/recipes) is meant for people with a collection of recipes they want to share with family and friends or simply store them in a nicely organized way. A basic permission system exists but this application is not meant to be run as a public page.

## Configuration

Please check Tandoor Recipes documentation : https://docs.tandoor.dev/install/docker/

```yaml
    "SECRET_KEY": "str",
    "DB_TYPE": "list(sqlite|postgresql_external|mariadb_addon)" # Mariadb is automatically configured is the addon is installed, sqlite does not need configuration
    "ALLOWED_HOSTS": "str?",
